Would you be open to providing a complimentary batch so I \ncan evaluate what's on offer?\n\nTo be transparent, access alone doesn’t guarantee inclusion in the \narticle—I’m aiming to highlight a range of tools based on speed, \nquality, and variety. That said, I’m reviewing 10-12 apps to narrow the \nlist down to six.\n\nMy most recent article for Jotform was \nwww.jotform.com/ai/best-ai-paraphrasing-tool \n<https://www.jotform.com/ai/best-ai-paraphrasing-tool/>\n\nLet me know if that’s something you’d be open to.

This \nupdate will make your workflows more reliable and sets the foundation for \nexciting new features we're building. \nWhat's happening? \nStarting July 22, 2025, we're updating how Paths execute in your Zaps. \nPreviously, all branches in a Path ran simultaneously (parallel). Now, they'll \nrun in sequence—one after the other. This change will not affect the logic of \nyour Zaps, only Path branches where conditions within the branch are met will \nexecute, exactly the same as before. \nWill this affect my Zaps? \nIn most cases, you'll notice no change. However, Zaps may behave differently \nif: \n * You have multiple Path branches designed to run at the same time \n * One Path branch includes steps like Delay, Code, Looping, Digest, or \nSub-Zaps \n * You're relying on when a step runs across different branches (not just if \nit runs) Example: If Path A includes a Delay for 1 day, and Path B triggers a \nSlack message immediately—under the new behavior, Path B's steps will be held \nuntil Path A finishes. This could delay downstream outcomes unless reordered. \nHow to mitigate any potential issues: \n\n * Check your Path step order: Branches will now run top to bottom and then \nleft to right—so the order in which you set them up will matter. \n * Move time-sensitive steps higher up in the branch list if needed. \n * Split into multiple Zaps using Sub-Zaps if steps must run in parallel, or \ncombine into the same path branch. \nNeed more time to adjust? \nIf you'd prefer to keep the current parallel execution of Path branches while \nyou prepare for this change, we've temporarily added an option in your Zap's \nAdvanced Settings. You can toggle \"Use parallel Path execution\" to maintain the \nparallel behavior. Please note this setting will be available untilSeptember \n30, 2025, after which all Paths will use the new sequential execution. \nWhy the change? \nThis update is part of our commitment to making Zapier more reliable and \npowerful. The new sequential execution offers: \n * ✅ More predictable troubleshooting—Paths run in a clear order, making it \neasier to identify and fix issues \n *  ✅ Fewer rate-limiting errors—Sequential execution reduces the chance of \nhitting rate limits \n *  ✅ Foundation for future enhancements—This change enables us to build more \nadvanced Path features \nWhat to expect \nJuly - September 2025: We'll update Path execution across all Zaps during this \nperiod.\n\n📖 Product documentation: sequential path runs \n<https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/37562074726029-Now-available-sequential-path-runs>\n💬 Need help? Our support team <https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us> is here. \n\nThank you for using Zapier!

    "description": "Hi Team,\n\nI’m reaching out with a direct and respectful request. I’m in the process of rebuilding my professional brand after a few difficult years—and a high-quality image is part of that.\n\nI’ve tested several similar platforms, and I’ll be honest—many overpromised and underdelivered. I’ve seen misleading previews, poor final results, and support that vanished the moment payment cleared. So I’ve learned to approach these services with caution—and intentionality.\n\nThat’s why I’m reaching out to you. From what I’ve seen, BetterPic appears to be different: more polished, more ethical, and more invested in long-term trust. That matters to me. I work in public service, and while my budget is limited, I’m deeply loyal to companies that do right by their users.\n\nIf you offer any trial access, promo code, or entry-level discount, I’d love the opportunity to evaluate your service firsthand. If it’s as good as I suspect, you won’t just gain a customer—you’ll gain an advocate. I’ve built trust in communities that rely on strong word-of-mouth, and I’m always looking to share quality tools that actually deliver.\n\nEither way, thank you for your time and your consideration.\n\nWarm regards,\nJeffrey Meyers",

    "description": "Hi AISuitUp team,\n\nWe work with a lot of AI companies and know churn rates are high (avg 8–30%/mo).\n\nOne thing top companies in your space (like Jasper AI, n8n, OpusClip, and Synthesia) are doing to fight this is adding a smart cancellation flow with targeted offers when users click “Cancel my subscription.”\n\nThese flows typically cut churn by 20–30%.\n\nDo you have something like that in place?\n\nIf not, we offer a solution that many AI companies use to set up an effective flow in minutes: dontchurn.io.\n\nOpen to a quick chat?",

    "description": "Greetings Simon. \nThanks for your email and for this incredible opportunity to give us such a product. SuitUp came to me at the very right time. I am trying to set up my website and I needed great pics to use. Now thanks to you, I have plenty.  This is the best amount of money I have spent in a very long time. Its worth every penny. I am so grateful. \n\nNow I want to ask for something else. Do you do videos or short clips. When you look at the site www.semboss85.com, there are pictures I wanna change with those that have my face. Right from the landing video with the lady on a laptop. I want a short clip of mine seated on a laptop in her position to replace that. Then also the other pictures below. I need versions of myself. Can you advise and tell me how much it would cost me?\n\nThank you. Let me also fill the survey as honestly as possible.  But i am incredibly impressed by your work and by you reaching out to me.\n\nRegards,\nJohn Bosco\n\nOn Tue, Jul 8, 2025, 2:49 PM Ai SuitUp <info@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nHello, I’m Simon.\n\nI'm the Founder of Ai SuitUp and I'm writing you since you have used AI SuitUp recently.\n\nFirst of all, thank you very much for taking the time to try AI SuitUp, we appreciate it incredibly!\nI'm contacting you to know if you could take a quick survey (https://u30879356.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.csgqcsCvzVm7rgSnvZpkxvXi-2BsYoceQKxYvF2x3boxON6zQ8SYPxtrUkvDGiU2ObmHTX65ZCnAmmZHKdyK3xAv475K-2BnrteQ-2FZDkpcLIL94-3DdZ0I_0jgNyzQhQY3peTb05WzFvEvRo7GXBqrSUJDMo4W6gsrpzjcPtuA3-2FAEIpETLeaPEGNCIkj-2Fnlmm-2FATn1ugiTMKeDoc7jKG1a9x5fHTi-2Bp9o1niGh-2B711gmNGSw3X-2BD1mfPmo7fs52DJi3kn4LxDLWVicwVqySQfCnk9Ya6LYxH8VgqKwTl28F3WeyGL5Sq59BO3XEl-2FOlV1vDf5xdbBHmqY7Y5F8UE9Wqy-2F59e6caLw-3D) (takes less than 60 seconds) to provide your feedback about the product.\n\nYour feedback is incredibly important to us, I hope you can find a few seconds to complete the survey.

I'd love to show you exactly what's holding it back and how we can fix it.\n\nI’ve opened a few slots this week — go ahead and let me know which weekday works for you for a 15 minutes call. This is the fastest way to start seeing real results.  \n\nOnce I have your available time, we’ll move forward right away.\n\nThank You\n\n\n\n\n\nKhushi Sharma\nSEO Marketing Analyst\n\n   + 1 (727) 476-7428 (https://d5scTS04.na1.hs-sales-engage.com/Ctc/L2+23284/d5scTS04/Jks2-6qcW69sMD-6lZ3kGW5DTtj-37-r6PW94K6cN1bsX7MW2mvYHY3Bdqk-W3lgJ9X5zmSXLW2gZBg44P51fpW5qVm-t8LLBzCW6fd6Pt4Vs_RbV2TY6g2L5Wx6W3yRh9_2Qxxy4W6KY1zj4s52-JW8gCgpS7rxC-LW7z4_K64Gyl2-W27ZbW-5jHSp6W3hFj328Vj_B3W3W8K7G4RY5ymW29H8Bp8SXNvjW933hgY2nV3qcW3kRQBR36p4c5W3Sq-MV31bSjbW20lW-F8QLnkGf7kYyFC04)\n   khushi.sharma@wildnettechnologies.com\n   www.wildnettechnologies.com (http://www.wildnettechnologies.com/)\n  1825 Northwest Corporate Boulevard Boca           Raton, Florida 33431, USA",

I'd be happy to help you with the process of fixing the backgrounds.\n\nFor the fingers, there isn't anything we can do to 'fix' them, unfortunately; there are two options, though. You can either choose another image that doesn't have this issue, or we can generate a new batch for that person for free. Please inform me of your preferred course of action.\n\nOnce everyone has the appropriate image, kindly send me a zip folder with the pictures (downloaded in high resolution) that require editing. Additionally, please provide me with a reference image for the background you wish to use.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.\n\nBest,\nChiara, AI SuitUp Team\n\nThis email is a service from Ai SuitUp.

I understand that results may vary, but in this case, I do not believe any of the headshots are usable.\n\nGiven this, I would like to request a refund.

The chest and shoulders belong to someone else. I do not have the freckles that are depicted on many of the images, and my hair options were limited. My hair is not pixie short, nor is it shoulder length. There is potential for some of them to look more like a representation of me, but being jobless makes it so I cannot afford to pay for upgrades. The price I already paid while crossing my fingers makes me anxious.\nDeletion confirmation: True\n\n\nSomeone from the team will review your request to verify your eligibility and get back to you within 1-2 business days",

    "description": "Hello,\n\nI’ve been following your company’s impressive work and growth through strategic advertising. But even with strong ad performance, there’s one challenge nearly every high-performing business faces: most website visitors leave without taking any action. In fact, over 97% of traffic typically bounces leaving a significant amount of potential revenue on the table.\n\nAt VIQ Concepts, we specialize in Retention Optimization, a conversion-first system that helps businesses like yours turn underperforming websites into high-converting customer journeys. Our approach doesn’t require increasing your ad spend. Instead, we focus on maximizing the value of the traffic you’re already generating.\n\nWe help companies:\n1. Triple their conversions using the same traffic\n2. Reduce bounce rates and eliminate dead-end user flows\n3. Build loyalty and referral systems that increase customer lifetime value\n4. Implement automated email flows to recover and convert cold leads\n\nFor your business, this means more revenue, better ROI from your current marketing efforts, and an overall smoother path from visitor to customer. This service can work alongside your existing strategies and integrates seamlessly without disrupting your current setup.\n\nWould you be open to a quick 15-minute chat to explore how Retention Optimization could align with your current goals and unlock new growth opportunities?\n\nLooking forward to connecting.",

I have recommended AI Suitup to three different clients at my company after generating headshots on behalf of my boss. \n\nHowever, on a whim to use myself, I ended up receiving photos that simply do not look like me. While I chose regular build, the body is far too skinny for me, my hair is different despite choosing mid-length, and my face just looks far too different to use the photos. \n\nI found one that seemed somewhat acceptable but am frustrated that only one out of the 50 are similar when my boss’ were all so accurate. I would like to re-upload a reference photo for new generation. Please let me know who I can best speak to to resolve this issue. Thank you so much.\n\nBest,\nApril Yi\n\nSent from my iPhone",

As part of this change, you will \nneed toupdate your code by July 7, 2025 to avoid disruption. \n\n\nWe’ve covered the full details in the changelog \n<https://developers.webflow.com/data/changelog?utm_source=iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=apiupdates-july2025>\n, but here’s a summary of what you need to know. \n\n\n\nWhat’s changing\n\n\n\nUnpublishing live items\nPreviously, updating a live item’s isDraft property to true would unpublish it \nfrom the site. To support improved draft management, settingisDraft: true will \nnow no longer unpublish the item. Instead, you can unpublish live items using \ntheunpublish endpoint \n<https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/cms/collection-items/live-items/delete-items-live?utm_source=iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=apiupdates-july2025>\n. The item will remain live while draft updates can be made using staged item \nendpoints. \n\n\nPublish items when domains are out of sync\nGood news! Those pesky 409 errors when publishing CMS items with out-of-sync \ndomains? Gone! You can now publish items using thepublish items endpoint \n<https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/cms/collection-items/staged-items/publish-item?utm_source=iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=apiupdates-july2025>\n even when domains are out of sync. No code changes needed — it just works. \n\n\n\nRequired actions\n\n\n\nPlease update your code to use either the Unpublish Single Item \n<https://developers.webflow.com/data/v2.0.0/reference/cms/collection-items/live-items/delete-item-live?utm_source=iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=apiupdates-july2025>\n orUnpublish Multiple Items \n<https://developers.webflow.com/data/v2.0.0/reference/cms/collection-items/live-items/delete-items-live?utm_source=iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=apiupdates-july2025>\n endpoint by July 7, 2025. \n\n\n\nTimeline & testing\n\n\n\n\n * Now through July 7: Test and update your code \n * On July 7: Changes go live in v2 \n\n\nLooking to test this functionality before the change? The new functionality is \nalready live in ourBeta APIs \n<https://developers.webflow.com/data/v2.0.0-beta/reference/cms/collection-items/staged-items/publish-item?utm_source=iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=apiupdates-july2025>\n — just switch/v2 to /beta in your API calls to test in your dev environment. \nNote: Webflow SDK doesn't support beta namespace yet. \n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n * Full Changelog \n<https://developers.webflow.com/data/changelog?utm_source=iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=apiupdates-july2025>\n * Forum Discussion \n<https://discourse.webflow.com/t/important-changes-to-cms-publishing/323920?utm_source=iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=apiupdates-july2025>\n * API Reference \n<https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference?utm_source=iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=apiupdates-july2025>\n\n\n We hope these updates make it easier for you to build and move faster in \nWebflow. We’re excited to get these improvements into your hands! \n\n\nHappy coding! ✨ \n\n\n The Webflow DevRel team \n\n\n\n <https://www.linkedin.com/company/webflow-inc-/>  \n<https://twitter.com/webflow>  <https://www.facebook.com/webflow/>  \n<https://www.instagram.com/webflow/>  <https://www.youtube.com/webflow>  \n<https://dribbble.com/webflow>  <https://www.tiktok.com/@webflow> \n Webflow Inc. 398 11th Street, 2nd floor, San Francisco, CA 94103 \nThis email was sent to info@aisuitup.com",

    "description": "Hi, \n\nI'm pretty disappointed in the quality of these photos. Specifically 90% of the photos looked 20-30 years younger than I am so are unusable in a business or personal setting.

I can’t tell if I’m doing something wrong, but they certainly don’t seem to be in high resolution (only 572kb file size) and likely won’t work for speaking engagements. Can you let me know? I’m attaching a reference photo for convenience \n\nThanks,\nDanny\nimage0.png",

    "description": "I cannot use any of these. None of them look like me - \n\n- The images generated were too artificial looking. Not very natural - I look plastic in many of them! \n- They all just made me look like a young cartoon version of myself. My eyes were too far apart, or too big, or my lips were too big, or my boobs were too big, or my forehead was too pronounced. Nothing about them looked natural actually, now that I am writing this. - the distribution of my features was just all off, so I look distorted in every image. \nThey all looked like a computer generated, too immaculate, too much photoshopping effects, which just ended up looking like an imaginary version of someone who is insecure or wanted to mislead the audience. I am neither of those things.  \n\n- I am slender and athletic - so any pictures that showed my bust (from the waist up),  were not only incredibly inaccurate, but inappropriate looking for my professional appearance. Not only do I not have cleavage, but I would NEVER show it in my professional head shots as an executive. You may want to add this to your intake form for women…there is no way me or my peers (in our mid-40s would get away with showing cleavage and be taken seriously, or respected) \n\nI hope this is somewhat helpful. \n\nPlease let me know what you can do to either refund or regenerate images for me. \nAnd, regardless, please delete all of these. \n\nThank you, \nGina \n\n\n> On Jun 17, 2025, at 4:49 PM, Ai SuitUp <info@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n> \n> \n> YOUR AI GENERATED HEADSHOTS ARE READY!\n> \n> Hello!\n> \n> Thank you for patiently waiting.

    "description": "Hello AI SuitUp,\n\nOn June 12, 2025 I submitted selfies and payment for your 100 headshots. I was pleased that the photos were returned within the specified timeframe. \n\nHowever, there are only a  very few of 100 photos that are even okay, and  the majority do not work at all as they do not reflect my hair color and hair style so do not  look enough like \"me\" to be utilized . \n During the process when I was asked to select hair color and hair style, I selected \" no preference\", as my hairstyle is short or pulled back from my face, and is neither a pixie or a bob, and my hair color could be considered white, gray or blond- so I left that also as ' no  preference \" .  I  incorrectly expected that AI  photos generated would \"learn\"  my hair style and hair color based on the photos I uploaded, and perhaps that was my error .\n\nI am not  satisfied with the results sent and have not downloaded any. This is because while the system did capture my facial features quite well, there are only 2-3 out of 100 photos that reflect my actual hair color and style-  so, what can be done  now ? Are you able to generate maybe 20-30  more photos using the hairstyles more similar to those I submitted in my selfies, and with white /gray /blondish hair coloring ?  Also, I prefer darker colors and green , so if you are able to send more photos, please generate them with darker black/navy or green clothing colors. \n\nI will await your feedback, \n\nThank you for your consideration of my request. \n\nSincerely, \nRita Madrigali \n   \n\nOn Thu, Jun 12, 2025 at 6:49 PM Ai SuitUp <info@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nYour AI generated headshots are ready!\n\nHello!\n\nThank you for patiently waiting.

(Increase the resolution of the first blurry photo where I am wearing a white shirt, and edit the dots from my lower lip in the second picture where I am wearing the green suit) \n\nThank you,\nJennifer \n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Jun 13, 2025 at 12:46 AM Ai SuitUp <info@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nYour AI generated headshots are ready!\n\nHello!\n\nThank you for patiently waiting.

    "description": "Hello!\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I recently received my headshots for order #09f39995-9c3b-48c5-a003-38368bd38dc3 and I didn't realize that my body size would be so varied and there's quite some that appear too thin, while others are larger than my actual build. This variation affects how my face shape is perceived in those photos. \n\nI wanted to reach out to ask if you would be open minded to helping with provide an opportunity for different headshots that are more closer to my body shape? I am in between a slim and regular size but with an athletic build. From what I can recall, the regular size option model seems to have wrists larger than mine, which made it challenging to select the best fit. I initially assumed the AI would select the most likely body size option automatically, but it seems this wasn’t the case. \n\nAdditionally, I noticed that some facial blemishes, such as acne scarring, are visible in the images. Would it be possible to generate versions with a smoother (but still realistic) complexion, without these blemishes like in some headshots?\n\nI truly appreciate the consideration.\n\nThank you so much,\nBrandon\n\nJun 12, 2025, 2:35 PM by info@aisuitup.com:\n\n>\n> Your AI generated headshots are ready!\n>\n> Hello!\n>\n>\n> Thank you for patiently waiting.

As I stated in my review, your AI software has a very narrow scope of hues for African Americans. Apparently, because I selected AA as my race (which I am), it generated images that were as much as 5 or 6 shades darker than I am, to the point of looking ridiculous. It also made me look 20 yrs younger, about 15lbs smaller, and exaggerated minor features in my face.

    "description": "Hello AI SuitUp Support Team,\nI am requesting a full refund for the headshots that I ordered. None are worth using because they are not a true or accurate reflection of the images that I submitted. As I stated in my review, your AI software has a very narrow scope of hues for African Americans. Apparently, because I selected AA as my race (which I am), it generated images that were as much as 5 or 6 shades darker than I am, to the point of looking ridiculous. It also made me look 20 yrs younger, about 15lbs smaller, and exaggerated minor features in my face. \n\nI chose your service for professional purposes, not to disguise myself or \"catfish\" the public. The images generated look nice, but they just don't look like me. Please let me know when I can expect a return of my funds.\n\nRegards,\nColette Pratt",

I never received my headshots as expected after 6 hours. It looks like I entered the wrong email address when filling out my order. Is there any way you can replace the email address I entered with justinytendler@gmail.com and resend my headshots to that address?\n\n \n\nWrong email: justintendler@gmail.com           \n\nCorrect email: justinytendler@gmail.com       \n\n \n\nSorry for the confusion. Thank you in advance for your assistance.\n\n \n\n \n\nThanks,\n\nJustin Tendler",

We know how critical your websites are \nto your business and to your customers, and we’re deeply sorry for any \ndisruption this incident caused. I want to ensure that we are taking ownership \nfor this incident and working diligently around the clock to ensure a similar \ndisruption never happens again. \n\n\nThe issue stemmed from an internal backend update and a cache refresh that \nunexpectedly strained our systems, causing outages and degraded performance \nacross some hosted sites, the Webflow Dashboard, and the Canvas. Our \nengineering and support teams responded rapidly, and while the core issue was \nstabilized within minutes, related performance issues persisted through the \nmorning UTC as we worked to fully restore service. \n\n\nBy early afternoon UTC, we had expanded capacity across multiple systems, \nresolved the underlying constraints, and achieved full stability. We’ve since \ncompleted an internal investigation to better understand the factors that \ncontributed to the incident and ensure we’re taking the right steps to prevent \nthis from happening again. \n\n\nOur promise to you: Performance and reliability are critical features that we \nwill continue to invest in heavily. We sincerely appreciate your trust and \npartnership, and we’re committed to doing better. \n\n\nSincerely, \n\n\nAllan Leinwand\nChief Technology Officer, Webflow \n\n\n\n <https://www.linkedin.com/company/webflow-inc-/>  \n<https://twitter.com/webflow>  <https://www.facebook.com/webflow/>  \n<https://www.instagram.com/webflow/>  <https://www.youtube.com/webflow>  \n<https://dribbble.com/webflow>  <https://www.tiktok.com/@webflow> \n Webflow Inc. 398 11th Street, 2nd floor, San Francisco, CA 94103",

    "description": "Hello- \n\nI have a question about my images. When I was looking at the options for hair length, body size, etc...I only saw 3 options on each. It looked like there were additional boxes to the right, but I didn't see a bar to scroll to the right and my arrow keys did not work to show other options either. I am very happy with my pictures, but they show me with a smaller body which isn't super realistic. I am wondering if there are other body types to choose from or if \"Curvy\" is the biggest one. If there are others, could I see the options and possibly have my images run through again?\n\nThanks,\nStacy\n\nOn Mon, Jun 2, 2025 at 11:28 AM Ai SuitUp <info@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nYour AI generated headshots are ready!\n\nHello!\n\nThank you for patiently waiting.

    "description": "Hi - \n\nAfter seeing how great my headshots came out, my husband put photos in (and used my email) for his AI headshots. He and I were both dismayed to see that the vast majority of photos appear to have indentations on either side of his forehead that aren't there on his actual forehead. These indentations are visible in almost all headshots, and the most of the ones that are not as pronounced do not look like my husband, so there are really one or two out of 150 that work for him. As you can imagine, he would not have paid for the highest tier if he though he'd only have a couple of shots to select from. \n\nI'm not sure if these can be rerun or if you can let us know if one of the photos he uploaded had shading or something that may have become exacerbated by the AI rendering. I appreciate any help you can provide. \n\nThank you,\nStacy & Travis\n\nOn Mon, Jun 2, 2025 at 9:24 PM Ai SuitUp <info@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nHello, I’m Simon.\n\nI'm the Founder of Ai SuitUp and I'm writing you since you have used AI SuitUp recently.\n\nFirst of all, thank you very much for taking the time to try AI SuitUp, we appreciate it incredibly!\nI'm contacting you to know if you could take a quick survey (https://u30879356.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.csgqcsCvzVm7rgSnvZpkxvXi-2BsYoceQKxYvF2x3boxON6zQ8SYPxtrUkvDGiU2Ob7bBTARiEau-2BoRwSLf76jxaDnP9RfXLz14qMsT027hEY-3D6goT_EaG1VKz3nCxtSkX2UA6rMW2DO31AP77XejWTYG99QZOVbynTOL6910ChXYA4Xk19Py5sjxxyPaD8ZIk8zaYedKPr9RLo8SL-2FGTyZXps0URL8xlOkO6cFhq3nCnabeBLIEc4d-2FMA3I1CueNx04QY1o0K6JTXUxnKqdMJeNnJJoGXAGnl0AM44xPjMb8KCEMWJpdCje5zbNE5GZZHfhbWEguKRjPeSXM8wed2eMoXLGV0-3D) (takes less than 60 seconds) to provide your feedback about the product.\n\nYour feedback is incredibly important to us, I hope you can find a few seconds to complete the survey.

    "description": "Hi,\n\nI recently received my AI-generated photos through AI SuitUp, and unfortunately, I’m extremely disappointed with the results. The images do not represent my facial features accurately at all. Several of them include details I do not have, such as facial marks or exaggerated jawlines, making them feel completely unrecognizable to me.\n\nGiven that I provided clear reference photos, I was expecting results that were at least somewhat faithful to my real appearance. Sadly, I do not feel comfortable using any of the generated images.\n\nFor this reason, I kindly request a full refund, as the product did not meet my expectations nor the quality promised.\n\nThank you for your time and understanding.\nBest regards,\nJunior Senra",

Thank you for your help!\n\nRespectfully,\n\nMatthew Coleman\n \n\nOn Fri, May 30, 2025 at 10:37 AM Ai SuitUp <info@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nYour AI generated headshots are ready!\n\nHello!\n\nThank you for patiently waiting.

    "description": "Thanks for the updates based on my feedback. The hair is now fine in most photos but there are a few issues that still make none of the pictures usable because they don't look like me:\n\n1. There is too much sheen and 2 big protrusions on my forehead which are not part of my head. My forehead looks shiny in my photos but my head does not have those protrusions (which is what I think the AI is trying to replicate)\n\n2. My cheeks are two bright - my face is more matte in general\n\n3. My nose is too rounded in the middle and does not look like mine\n\n4. The complexion is slightly off (slightly too dark in many photos and missing the mixed undertones in my skin)\n\nIf this is too many changes or would be too much work or you don't think the system can make the necessary updates I'm happy to just take my money back. I would prefer to get photos I can use but also understand this may be difficult. Let me know how you would like to proceed.\n\nCheers,\nAlexei\n\nGet BlueMail for Android (https://bluemail.me)\nOn May 28, 2025, at 8:26 AM, Ai SuitUp <info@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nYour AI generated headshots are ready!\n\nHello!\n\nThank you for patiently waiting.

    "description": "Hi team,\n\nI have 2 major problems which makes all of these images unusable.\n\n1. All of the shots have me with hair but I no longer have hair or have a very thin amount in some of my uploads as shown. I specified bald so I thought the image generator would make all the shots bald. When I do have hair my hair is curly but I would need all of these shots done with me bald.\n\n2. For some reason all of the shots have me with some kind of bumps or protrusions in my forehead which I don't have in real life (you can also see this from my source photos)\n\n3. There is a bit too much smoothing in all the shots which has them look AI-generated/ took airbrushed. If this can't be fixed I understand but would prefer shots that don't look so artificial.\n\nUpdating #1 and #2 are critical (especially #1) for all of my shots. If you are going to make updates please know I need more of the shots in a suit or a collared shirt as these are for professional headshots which is why I chose your service. I hope to hear from you soon. Thanks for your support with these issues.\n\nCheers,\nAlexei\n\nGet BlueMail for Android (https://bluemail.me)\nOn May 27, 2025, at 7:10 PM, Ai SuitUp <info@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nYour AI generated headshots are ready!\n\nHello!\n\nThank you for patiently waiting.

En primer lugar, solicitamos la generación de imágenes para mi pareja (Letizia.fascetto@icloud.com) y hemos quedado extremadamente satisfechos con el resultado.\n\nSin embargo, en mi caso particular (a.f.verdaguer@icloud.com), lamentablemente los resultados no han cumplido con nuestras expectativas. De las imágenes generadas, solamente una o dos reflejan adecuadamente mi apariencia real, mientras que el resto se perciben claramente como imágenes generadas por IA de baja calidad. Además, notamos cambios significativos en rasgos faciales, lo que hace que las fotografías no sean útiles para nuestro objetivo profesional.\n\nPor lo anterior, solicitamos amablemente la devolución del importe pagado, o bien, un código de descuento del 100% para realizar una nueva solicitud con una selección diferente de fotografías iniciales, con el fin de obtener mejores resultados.\n\nQuedamos atentos a vuestra pronta respuesta y solución al respecto.\n\nMuchas gracias por vuestra atención.\n\nUn cordial saludo,\nAlejandro Verdaguer\n\nEl 21 may 2025, a las 15:25, Ai SuitUp <info@aisuitup.com> escribió:\n\n﻿\n\nYour AI generated headshots are ready!\n\nHello!\n\nThank you for patiently waiting.

I loaded in probably 10 or 15 pictures that were flagged bad and every picture I could find of myself and what I got was really not good.  I would like to try again by uploading 15 different angles of selfies to see if that looks better. My wife got hers today also and got a lot of good versions for her $37. Please let me know how to proceed, if I loaded a collage of my pictures for the free headshots this will not help your site as they are too different. \n\nThanks,\nJustin Stone",

    "description": "Hi team, I’m Batuhan, one of the founding members of fal.ai (http://fal.ai/) . Our entire thesis is image generation models have been slow, and we are here to come and change that! We have the fastest FLUX.1 inference (with LoRAs) in the world, but on top of that we now also have the fastest LoRA training (specifically designed for headshots/people/products) that comes under a minute (for 1500 steps) with the most perfect results. If you are also using any sort of upscaler, virtual try-on model or a video generation pipeline; you can move that traffic to fal as well and bundle the spend together to unlock even better discounts.\n\nIf this sounds interesting, I'd love to hop on a call myself. Or if you prefer to first test it yourself, please check it out here (ignore the list price, it’ll get much cheaper with your scale).\n\n→ Training: https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/turbo-flux-trainer\n\n→ Inference: https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/flux-lora\n\nAlso here is a $20 coupon https://fal.ai/coupon-claim/TURBOTRAINER for your testing.

I’m reaching out regarding a matter that I believe may involve your company indirectly. My name is Jessi Joachim, and I own a website called The Coffee Mom. Over the past few months, I worked with a freelancer who placed a link on my site pointing to your website as part of what appeared to be an SEO outreach initiative.\r\nUnfortunately, despite multiple follow-ups and extended patience, I have not been paid for this work, and the freelancer is now unresponsive. Based on my experience, it’s common for companies to hire SEO agencies, who in turn often subcontract freelancers to handle outreach and link placements like this.\r\nThe unpaid work involves the following post on my site:\r\n🔗 Post URL: https://www.thecoffeemom.net/create-free-ai-videos-in-1-minute-through-vidnoz-ai/\r\nThe corresponding invoice can be viewed here for your reference:\r\n💳 Invoice Link: https://www.paypal.com/invoice/p/#PEPDY38R3NRWZRSP\r\nI completely understand that your team may not be aware of the specifics of this arrangement, but I am hoping someone at AI SuitUp can assist me in resolving this. Ideally, I’d appreciate your help either by:\r\n\r\n  *\r\nPutting me in contact with the SEO company or agency you’ve partnered with for this campaign, or\r\n  *\r\nConnecting me with someone internally who can look into this matter further.\r\n\r\nFor transparency, I have all original emails, invoices, and documentation related to this issue and am happy to provide them if needed. I want to emphasize that this type of situation is rare, and reaching out directly to a client company is always a last resort for me when all other avenues have failed.\r\nThank you so much for your time and understanding—I really appreciate any assistance you can offer, and I look forward to hearing from your team soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:902f98c3-d56a-4f76-ba28-280b9ac0ec5e]\r\n________________________________\r\nFrom: Jessi Joachim <Jessi@thecoffeemom.net>\r\nSent: Thursday, May 1, 2025 2:54 PM\r\nTo: emma heesters <emmaheesters29@gmail.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Need a link insertion\r\n\r\nHi Emma,\r\nIt has now been over two weeks since you last responded, asking for an additional 2–3 days to resolve payment for Invoice #2651.

I'm happy to chat about guest posts and link inserts on my US based websites. I’ve put together a spreadsheet<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C7a4Yy7KuC0Ye-vCYQPBK6X9TTPsXzGfyuU-EyxogkM/edit?usp=sharing> with guest post and link insert pricing across all my sites. The listed rates are already my best pricing.\r\nContent Guidelines\r\n\r\n  *\r\nAll posts must be original and not posted elsewhere online.\r\n  *\r\nThe content must be relevant to the niche of the website.\r\n  *\r\nThe post needs to be sent in a Google Doc with edition permissions. Do not send a PDF.\r\n  *\r\nThe post should be a minimum of 500 words in length.\r\n  *\r\nCan contain up to 3 do-follow links\r\n  *\r\nI reserve the right to make spelling, grammatical, and SEO optimization edits to the post. The anchor text and links will not be altered in any way. Images, Meta descriptions, slug, Meta titles, and headers may be edited to ensure a proper fit with the site content and SEO optimization. I will add in relevant internal links as well.\r\n\r\nContent Information\r\n\r\n  *\r\nAll posts will be placed into a relevant category on the website.\r\n  *\r\nNo posts will be marked as sponsored or guest unless requested\r\n  *\r\nAll links are do-follow and permanently placed unless requested otherwise.\r\n\r\nTurnaround Time\r\n\r\n  *\r\nTurnaround time is 48 hours as long as placed on a weekday.\r\n  *\r\nOrders placed on Friday nights, Saturdays, or Sundays will be completed on Monday.\r\n  *\r\nRushed orders are offered with an additional fee.\r\n\r\nContent Editing and Exclusivity Terms\r\n\r\n  *\r\nFuture Content Edits: I reserve the right to update content in the future to maintain relevance and SEO value. This includes adding or modifying external and internal links, updating text, and changing stock images. Anchor texts and core links will remain unchanged once your post is fully paid.\r\n  *\r\nNo Exclusivity Guaranteed: Exclusive content placement is not guaranteed unless specifically negotiated. If exclusivity is required (i.e., avoiding direct competitors within your niche), please discuss with me for additional terms and fees.\r\n  *\r\nAdvertisement Policy: Posts include automatically generated ads and these will not be removed unless a no-ad advertisement agreement is made. If you prefer your post to be ad-free, we can discuss additional fees for such arrangements.\r\n\r\nThese terms ensure that both parties understand the flexibility and ongoing management involved with the published content, maintaining its effectiveness and relevance over time.\r\nPayment\r\n\r\n  *\r\nPayment is to be made through PayPal or Stripe, please specify which you prefer.\r\n  *\r\nAfter completing the work, you will receive an invoice with the remaining amount owed.\r\n  *\r\nAll invoices are due upon receipt. If payment is not made within 30 days of the invoice being received, then there will be a $25 late fee added. This fee will continue to be added weekly until the invoice is paid.\r\n\r\nWhen sending your order, please include your email and any company information you require on the invoice. If you do not send the information, the invoice will be sent using your email address as the billable address. If this needs to be changed after sending the invoice, there will be a replacement fee of $10.\r\nI look forward to working with you.

    "description": "Hello Taylor! \nSupport has not reached out, but given this is an urgent matter, I ask you kindly to escalate the following request to customer support leaders: \n\n--- \n\nHi All! \nI'm Flavio Di Palo and I'm the Owner of Deep Rest LLC, the company operates a AI Headshots generation service (aisuitup.com) and RunPods is our main GPU provider for model fine-tuning.\nWe have identified an issue in our billing, in particular, starting from May 3rd 2025 our Average Daily Spent on RunPods has grown from $612.99 from $194.86 (daily average from April 13th to May 2nd). \n\nThis growth is not associated with a growth in usage on our service hence we have investigated further. \nIt turns out that several Pods have been running constantly on our account since May 3rd, those Pods have not shut down despite our code signaling to shut down once the model fine-tuning is completed. \nI have shut down those pods manually and I can provide the IDs for those executions if your technical team needs to investigate further.\n\nAs there has been no change in our code managing Run Pod interaction in the last 6 months we have to inpute this defect to an issue on RunPods Pods infrastructure management side.\nFor this issue we have been unjustly billed, and we already paid a total of $6,129.90 from May 3rd to May 13th vs. a projected cost of $1,753.76 (assuming same daily usage and cost of April 13th to May 2nd period). \n\nAs we have all the reason to believe this was an issue on the Run Pod side we kindly demand you to: \n1. Reimburse the difference of $4,376.14 to our Credit Card on File. \n2. OR to provide a RunPod Credit for the total $6,129.90 to be used in the next 6 month,  to compensate for the hussle and the anticipated payment we have already finalized. \n\nPlease find the data to used for this analysis reported in this Google Doc for completeness: \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eDHanKOb9P88VS-6S6L3v8KIq12mE1dsxfO1DRfNoDM/edit?usp=sharing\n\nPlease let us know if you are aware of any issue on your side that might have caused this. \nAs we have always found a great partner in Run Pod we would prefer the \"Credits\" reimbursement option as we count on this service for the long run. \n\nI wish you a great day! \nFlavio.\nFounder of DEEP REST LLC. \nᐧ\n\nOn Tue, May 13, 2025 at 6:48 AM Taylor Pietrantozzi <taylor.pietrantozzi@runpod.io> wrote:\n\nHey Flavio - Interesting, I would recommend reaching out to RunPod Support (https://contact.runpod.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) . \n\nAnd in regards to the discounts, let me follow up with my team. \n\nAlso, let me go how it goes with support.\n\nTaylor Pietrantozzi \nRunPod, Inc. \nMeet with Taylor (https://d2s9mr04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/DP+113/d2S9mR04/VVPCG55YqyfDW487f6l3_j6xNW6WXg815tR14zN3mxJ663lbWxW69sMD-6lZ3pXN4NrsBMp6Y8pN3cv7_JjHw3xW4r_Cpw33Kg2mW8K4grH498S0NW7FDp4S3vrfPkW26gK_r4Tvxy2W3TYClP12VHPxW2NmYq_1YcqVyW3k0vP57ZPsqqW5kVPny4xWMH9W6jRTFs6X1bwCW7rdtK360w89QVkNV9J99N2z6VNRRpc6vvDwyW8zL8sf3TN9h3W7V7snH70RDJXW6cr5mV5LPyqZMgRd51zHNr5W3l79pq7-mjSBW7T6K1C8c9KDhf2n8Z_K04)\n\n\n\nOn Tue, May 13, 2025 at 3:42 AM Marketing AI SuitUp <marketing@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nHello Actually we are experiencing some abnormal costs for Rundpods pods while our user usage should be decreasing (See attached) \nWho is the right person that can help us check on this? \n\nI wish you a great day! \nFlavio. \n\nᐧ\n\nOn Sat, May 10, 2025 at 5:05 PM Marketing AI SuitUp <marketing@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nHello Taylor! \nI hope everything is going well. \n\nI remember discussing with your colleagues about potential discounts on RunPods for AI SuitUp, but we never followed up on that. \nAny chance we can resume the conversation? \n\nI wish you a great day! \nFlavio. \nᐧ\n\nOn Mon, Mar 17, 2025 at 10:32 PM Marketing AI SuitUp <marketing@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nHello! \nSure, let's chat tomorrow. \nᐧ\n\nOn Mon, Mar 17, 2025 at 12:51 PM Taylor Pietrantozzi <taylor.pietrantozzi@runpod.io> wrote:\n\nHey Flavio - Just making sure that time tomorrow works for you for our follow up call. \n\nLooking forward to it! \n\nTaylor Pietrantozzi \nRunPod, Inc. \n\n\n\nOn Wed, Mar 12, 2025 at 11:59 AM Marketing AI SuitUp <marketing@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nGreat speaking with you today Taylor! \n\nBTW for the blogpost topic:\nWe migrated from AWS to Runpods and saved 85% on GPU cost, I think that would be a cool story to share. \n\nI wish you a great day! \nFlavio. \n\n\nᐧ\n\nOn Wed, Mar 12, 2025 at 8:52 AM Marketing AI SuitUp <marketing@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nYou can get your headshots here: \nhttps://web.aisuitup.com/new_order?coupon=HAJycTtVj4M\n\nThank you! \nFlavio. \nᐧ",

One photo shows my correct skin tone, and I’m hoping it can be used as a guide for adjusting the others.\nCould my skin be lightened in the other images to better match the accurate one? Please let me know if this can be done.\nThank you for your time and help.\n\nBest Regards, \nGiovanni Guzman804-767-4286\n    On Wednesday, May 7, 2025 at 02:32:22 PM GMT-4, Ai SuitUp <info@aisuitup.com> wrote:  \n \n  \nPayment received!\n\nHello!\n\nThank you for choosing our service to create stunning, AI-generated images!\n\nIf you experience any problem with uploading your images,use this link to start the upload over.\n\nYour payment has been received and we are thrilled to get started on your unique creations.Our team has worked to obtain top quality AI-generated images.Keep an eye on your inbox: we'll be sending you an email as soon as your images are ready.\n\nPlease feel free to contact us if anything goes wrong with your order.\n\nWe truly appreciate your business and can't wait for you to see the results!\n\nThe AI SuitUp Team\ninfo@aisuitup.comUnsubscribe From This List | Manage Email Preferences\ngio office 1.png",

    "description": "Hello - I purchased a package today & have received my photos back. The photos look very realistic! Unfortunately there’s only 2 that I would be able to comfortably use. I was curious if I could request any changes to the photos so that maybe I could use more of them? If so, I was wondering if these components could be tweaked on all of the photos:\n\n1. Could you make the hair all mid length like this photo?\nimage0.png\n2. All of the builds are quite thin, could you make them slightly less thin, I’m thin to regular build, but most of these, the upper body/arms are too narrow to look like me. \n\n3. I’m in my mid 30s and these are all a bit young looking. Is there a way to age them a bit more slightly? \n\nThanks for considering!\nEmily",

Having seen mine, I'm unhappy with the way the generations look with facial hair. Most of the selfies I used were current ones where I had some facial hair, but I think the headshots would look better without. Is it possible to do that?

    "description": "Hi there,\n\n \n\nI’m interested in having our team (around 20 employees) sign up for either the Professional or Executive plan, but I had a few questions before moving forward:\n\n1. Professional Plan – Do the available styles include options with suits and/or blazers?\n2. Executive Plan – Could you clarify what the “Exclusive Styles” include that aren’t available in the Professional plan?\n3. Bulk Purchase – Is there a way to purchase multiple plans (e.g., 20) in a single transaction using one card, and then assign them to individual employees via email?\n4. Group Rates – Do you offer any volume discounts?\nFor example, if we purchase 20 Executive plans at $57 each, would it be possible to receive group pricing equivalent to the Professional plan rate of $37 each?\n\n \n\nLooking forward to your response. Thanks in advance for your time and support!\n\n \n\nKind Regards,\n\n \n\nHylana Almeida | Vice President of Talent & Sales Operations\n\nReadyWorks (https://www.readyworks.com/)  | 212-912-3123 | LinkedIn (http://linkedin.com/in/hylana)",

In general, 1) the AI headshot images showed too much facial distortion — exaggerated wrinkles, sunken hallow faces, facial hair, sunken cheeks, ears mis-sized  2) eyeglasses were not mine or mis-shaped, 3) background settings weren’t good; I’d never get a photo in front of trees or in a room with people in the background 4) dress style was not good. I just don’t dress that way, and the one or two that did resemble how I dress had distortions. My expectation in paying for the top package was to end up with a good set of photos for a variety of uses — work profile, professional for LinkedIn, casual for social media, etc. Unfortunately, the photos just don’t look like me. Maybe if there were choices available for setting and dress, that could be useful. But I’m sorry to say I simply can’t use these photos.\nDeletion confirmation: True\n\n\nSomeone from the team will review your request to verify your eligibility and get back to you within 1-2 business days",

    "description": "Hello AI SuitUp team,\n\nInteresting experiment but I will request a refund. I paid for the top package expecting to have several usable headshots for different places - casual, work, company web site, personal social media, different dress, etc. Unfortunately not a single image is “me.” I don’t dress that way. The glasses are badly sized or not mine. Too many rubber wrinkled sunken faces. Sorry to say the photos just don’t work.\n\nMaybe if there was a way to select your clothing style and accessories - what would you wear, what would you never wear? Same for setting - where would you get your photo taken, where would you never get your photo taken?\n\nCan you please provide a full refund, thank you.\n\nJerry\n\n\n\nOn Thu, May 1, 2025 at 6:04 PM Ai SuitUp <info@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nYour AI generated headshots are ready!\n\nHello!\n\nThank you for patiently waiting.

    "description": "Hi Simon,\n\nThanks for reaching out - I'd like to start with 2 pieces of honest feedback. \nFirstly, of all the various AI headshot generator tools I've tried recently, I felt that AI SuitUp had the highest # of photos out of the total photos generated that overall looked similar to my actual facial features (maybe 10 pounds lighter!). So, the accuracy to my real face, given the photos I uploaded, was impressive. The quality of the photos/backgrounds is crisp, clear.\n\nThe only drawback, which I was afraid of because I had similar issues with other tools as well, was the fact that only 3 photos were provided with hijab. Most of the photos I uploaded of myself include hijab. I wish that I could have had (all or at least some more photo options with hijab.\n\nIs there any adjustment that can be done with the existing results? I'm overall happy with the photos it generated but because I wear hijab and these results only provided 3 or maybe 4 photos with hijab, they are not actually of use for me. \n\nHoping your team can help,\n\nZainab\n\nOn Wed, Apr 30, 2025 at 12:58 PM Ai SuitUp <info@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nHello, I’m Simon.\n\nI'm the Founder of Ai SuitUp and I'm writing you since you have used AI SuitUp recently.\n\nFirst of all, thank you very much for taking the time to try AI SuitUp, we appreciate it incredibly!\nI'm contacting you to know if you could take a quick survey (https://u30879356.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.csgqcsCvzVm7rgSnvZpkxvXi-2BsYoceQKxYvF2x3boxON6zQ8SYPxtrUkvDGiU2ObnqCtJ2tzEjK6Rku5dqTCnpG7FhsvJ-2BSji2yf2tbMjnI-3D1w_X_uoK-2B4OXAQ40eAaD6c0GWrvr635qFrkgUxoYoXzfgjmVAAlmpnY-2FYGiaD0AB6eleW62ppsziwOd5XIE5FqABfySNpWN57gbkS08aEm7YL3WdlGJzsaqzByNsBpi5mpcGwFJCRb2SZVWdyb6ECfubAcQZvJmImIqFHUeuCQLp8Yrc3XRna9oUsCKCH-2FKCwseug1DW9R-2BbHFu7mjJDe1T0pstgeRgzLXb4A4NwA7hQFcr0t8XbavHF9Ia4T5BPym5yt) (takes less than 60 seconds) to provide your feedback about the product.\n\nYour feedback is incredibly important to us, I hope you can find a few seconds to complete the survey.

I am normal weight but are too skinny in the images, and I would have loved a couple shots with my glasses. If the questions led to more specific ones that might clarify meaning and precision, it seems like that could work better.\n\nI’d appreciate a new round of images with  these adjustments. At least with shorter, shoulder length hair—there were several images that seemed useable, but for the too long hair styles. FWIW  the overly straighten hair was also an issue but it seems like even it could have been workable had it been shorter. \n\nThank you,\nKristina",

Can I please be issued a refund as it’s past the deadline I needed the images for.\n\nThanks \nAmy \n\nOn Thu, Apr 17, 2025 at 1:07 PM AI SuitUp <info@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nHi Amy,\n\nApologies for the delay in replying to you but all your emails were marked as spam and the ticket for your request was never created. We are just now checking the folder.\n\nUpon reviewing the uploaded images, I've observed that several duplicate images have been identified. The system’s metadata comparison mechanism is based on the image’s content rather than its filename. Renaming an image does not alter its metadata. The images you tried to upload are, in fact, duplicated images. \n\nYou can resume your upload by clicking on this link: https://web.aisuitup.com/upload_ui?o=a2d62551-67b4-4820-8bf0-97d425613b1a\n\nPlease carefully read these instructions before uploading the new pictures:\n- Upload 15 frontal chest-up closeups taken in daylight. Do not upload full-body photos, too far away or too close (face cropped);\n- Each photo must have a different background, lighting conditions, clothes, and a slightly different facial expression. Avoid repeating backgrounds, outfits, and pictures taken on the same day.\n- Ensure you do not upload the same picture more than once.\n- Ensure that you don't upload screenshots.\n- Ensure your photos are good quality (>400 px). Do not upload dark, filtered (including b/w), post-produced, blurry, pixelated or AI generated pictures.\n- Ensure that your entire face is not covered and is clearly visible. Do not upload pictures with hats/beanies, sunglasses, hands/arms, headphones, speaker sets, or eye patches.\n- Ensure all the pictures are recent. Do not upload old pictures (e.g., completely different hairstyles or hair colors).\n- Each picture should have only your entire face. Do not upload photos with others (not even partially there), animals, or objects covering your face (including phones, hair, hands, or glare from glasses).\n- Avoid unprofessional/funny facial expressions (e.g., do not squint too hard) and exaggerated angles (e.g., side shots or photos taken from the top/bottom or while lying down).\n- Ensure that you look into the camera in all the pictures and that your eye color is clearly visible.\n\nBest,\nChiara, AI SuitUp Team\n\nOn Wed, Apr 2, 2025 at 7:22 PM Amy Lammers <amlammers07@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nHelp!

You were not supposed to paid twice since we provide everyone with a link to resume the upload in case of technical difficulties in the email confirming the payment. Unfortunately, given that you started a dispute, I can't proceed with a refund. To resolve this matter quickly and process your refund, I kindly request you to withdraw the payment dispute.\n\nOnce the dispute is withdrawn, I will ensure that the refund is processed promptly and the funds are credited back to your account.\n\nI appreciate your cooperation and am committed to resolving this issue to your satisfaction.\n\nBest regards,\nChiara, AI SuitUp Team",

There is no way to log back in\nto continue the project. Here is the ticket number I was sent, along with a\nscreenshot of the two confirmation emails with Amex payments to SuitUP.\n\nSo, I tried to log back in and had to pay once again. Since there is no way\nto log in, I thought that your system would recognize my email address and\nsee that I have not completed my previous project. I need a refund for the\npayment that was made on April 8th, as your website said money back\nguaranteed and that attempt was not able to complete.

When you select the options you only have Long and Short. For that reason, I had to purchase photos two times, one for each setting. In some photos of each they got the right length but most were either way too long or too short which is not realistic.

Unfortunately, the second set has actually turned out worse than the first, and I don’t feel the results meet the standard I was hoping for.\n\nOn that basis, I’d like to request a full refund. I haven’t downloaded any of the images, and I’m happy to follow whatever process is required to move this forward.\n\nCould you please confirm whether I need to submit a new refund request form, or if the original one will suffice?\n\nThanks again for your support—I really do appreciate it.\n\nKind regards,\nChris\n\nChristopher Arnold BSc (Hons) MLIBF CeMAP DipFA\n\nWealth Management Partner\n\n  \n\nT: 0208 302 1805\n\nM: 07852194822\n\nE: chrisarnold@tpllp.com\n\nW: chrisarnold.tpllp.com (http://www.chrisarnold.tpllp.com/)\n\nLocal Office: One Elmfield Park, Bromley, Kent, BR1 1LU",

Out of the 100 images received, fewer than 5 resemble me or are even remotely usable. The overall output does not reflect the quality I expected, especially considering the cost of the service.\n\nI’ve reviewed your refund policy and understand the terms. However, given the outcome, I would appreciate it if we could reattempt the headshot generation.

    "raw_subject": "Request for Redo – AI Headshots Did Not Accurately Reflect My Appearance",
    "description": "Dear AI Suit Up Team,\n\nI recently purchased the Professional package and used your platform to generate a set of AI headshots and wanted to reach out regarding an issue I encountered with the final results.\n\nWhile I appreciate the ease and overall quality of the renders, I noticed that the headshots produced do not accurately reflect my real-life appearance. I had selected the “Asian” setting during the generation process—as I am half Asian—but I am also half White and Pacific Islander. Unfortunately, the AI seems to have leaned heavily into the Asian features, resulting in headshots that my friends and family have confirmed do not look much like me. I am wondering if I chose a combination of races it may come out better? Or maybe since I appear more Asian I should have chosen White to balance it out?\n\nGiven that the system currently only allows for one ethnic selection, I understand this may have influenced the output. However, I was hoping for a more balanced and realistic representation. With that in mind, I’d like to request a redone set of headshots—ideally one that better reflects my mixed heritage and overall appearance. I’m happy to provide additional photos or input if that would help improve the result.\n\nPlease let me know what the next steps would be to move forward with this.\n\nThank you in advance for your time and assistance.\n\nBest regards,\nBrace Tyler\nBtyler001@gmail.com",

    "description": "Your refund request has been submitted! \nFirst name: Adrian\nLast name: Ponsen\nEmail: adr.ponsen@gmail.com\nUpload Guidelines: False\nDownloaded: False\nFeedback: Nowhere in the process of purchasing the Executive, $57 option for headshots did the AI Suitup website inform me I would need to upload 16 selfies to get a headshot. That is an excessive number of selfies that most grown men don't have. Since the option to purchase the  Executive $57 option appeared just after I had already uploaded the six selfies required for the free version, I assumed only those six selfies were required. I do not have 16 selfies and so I am not able to generate AI Suitup Executive quality headshots. If the website had clearly told me I would need 16 selfies I never would have made the purchase. I want my $57 back.  That is a more than reasonable request considering you have a 100% money back guarantee and I haven't actually generated selfies.  Don't respond that the money back guarantee is only for when people generate their headshots and don't like them as the customer support email service did when I initially emailed requesting a refund. That would be effectively telling me I still have the opportunity to get my money back, I just have to take 10 more selfies and then tell you I don't like the final product AISuitup generates. Let's be adults about this and save time for everyone by just issuing my refund now.\nDeletion confirmation: True\n\n\nSomeone from the team will review your request to verify your eligibility and get back to you within 1-2 business days",

    "description": "Hey team,\nJust got my results—some good stuff in there, but overall not quite what I was hoping for. Before I click the re-upload link, a few quick questions:\n\n1. Should I upload an entirely new set of images?\n2. Will the AI reference my original upload or just the new batch?\n3. Any tips on image selection for better results this time around?\n\nFor context: I tried to match the final style by submitting mostly older selfies of me dressed up—same suit, same haircut, same day. I threw in a few recent ones, but not many. I assumed giving it the “best version” of me would help, but the results came out pretty homogenous and a bit dated (age, weight, etc.)—lesson learned.\n\nSo now I’m wondering:\n– Should I include some of the same pics but add more variety?\n– Or go all-new since the system may already \"know\" those images?\n\nI don’t take many selfies, but I have tons of recent casual shots with friends I can crop. Would a mix of best-looking + more recent casual pics work better in your experience?\n\nThis is my first time using an AI image generation tool, so apologies if these are rookie questions. I can tell your tool’s solid—just hoping to dial in the output a bit more.\n\nThanks in advance,\nAlfredo\n\n\nAlfredo Carrillo\n\n917.725.0275 office\n917.757.9400 cell\nalfredocarrillo@gmail.com\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Apr 2, 2025 at 12:22 PM Ai SuitUp <info@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nPayment received!\n\nHello!\n\nThank you for choosing our service to create stunning, AI-generated images!\n\nIf you experience any problem with uploading your images, use this link (https://u30879356.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.csgqcsCvzVm7rgSnvZpkxkprchvk5Hw-2BxyBbr1pFfjU2pX7F-2FoXYna5gMpw9v3HPTE2uyuKqvj4gzDDFmOyUaPVefgl4HKPTq3JRwmRx8E24xUPRMloFBxUK0KXEngoxrEGS_Rv6nFX6loKg2tV8ZAdE5Qj6PVQP7Pu6ZW3gCqe5oZKCO8LhpiA6yzKBHROBQZWJOtpMhIWuzJskstcAh-2FalWJhz9lWlRrp57e2S5a6xrMKso4U-2B5UJbUox52CBRgv8dVI-2FluZT-2Bex3-2B5p256Z8J2dUt5kCK8eW2pcKhubI6dqEk3koGGtVI6zYgXR7z2gHs83OND52HWZ5oEQgQiRI8eg-2F11tRNhwX-2B-2Bg4Eu6Jk-2F2uTOdy-2BqTXAI54ZLg6edxlQC) to start the upload over.\n\nYour payment has been received and we are thrilled to get started on your unique creations.

In just a few weeks we will have a global presence on the web with a digital marine mammal naturalist certification training program.  There are five companies in the world who engage in this activity and they are all site specific, have an in person component, and are on 1-5 local marine mammal species.  Our program is worldwide, completely digital, covers the most commonly sighted 40 marine mammal species, has both certified and non-\ncertified options, and even discusses public speaking and the dreaded fear of the microphone!  There is a forum-open to anyone, a news blog, live Q and A from Kris Hunter, a marine mammalogist whose led over 6000 whale watches in three different oceans, pop quizzes, a open book final exam, and so much more.  Make a splash and join today!\n\nWhat would a headshot package price for me?

    "description": "Hello Andy,\n\nThanks for contacting us. We are sorry to hear that the quality of the pictures does not meet your expectations. Although most customers are happy with the results, sometimes the pictures may have below-average quality.\n\nAI results greatly depend on user inputs; unfortunately, most of yours do not adhere to the guidelines especially that \"Each photo must have a different background, lighting conditions, clothes, and a slightly different facial expression. Avoid repeating backgrounds, outfits, and pictures taken on the same day.\"\n\nPlease refer to our refund policy for any doubt: https://www.aisuitup.com/refund-policy\n\nWe'd happily provide you with a link to upload new pictures.\n\nBest,\nChiara, AI SuitUp Team\n\n\n* * *\nGood Afternoon,\n\nI regret having to send this message, as I had hoped for a better outcome, but I am requesting a refund for the photos I received. I was highly disappointed with literally all of the photos I received.  The resemblance is simply unacceptable for any professional use. Issues like the strange cleft chin (which I don't have), incorrect body proportions (large head with a tiny body), and strange teeth in many of the photos make them unusable for me.\n\nI'm not trying to overstate the situation, but considering your \"Money-Back Guarantee\" as stated on your website, I'm seeking a full refund for these photos. I've already obtained over 30 exceptional AI headshots from another service, so I would prefer a refund rather than attempting the process again.\n\nThanks for your time.\n\n- Andy Melin",

    "description": "Thank you for creating and sending.  This is my first time using your service, and while impressive, I noticed a few things:\n\n1) the instructions about choosing body type were not clear to me.  I have a bigger, broad-shouldered, heavier male body type but the choices to select from seemed limited to feminine descriptions (curvy, plus-sized) that are not appropriate options for men.  So I chose \"no preference\" thinking that my body size would be accurate based on the photos I uploaded.  Unfortunately this is not the case in the vast majority of the headshots that were produced.  Most of the headshots do not reflect my body type so seem very fake.\n\n2) in some of the photos the my hair is not touched up enough so appears frizzy and unprofessional.  This is especially the case in the one photo (3rd headshot) that does most accurately portray my body type/size.\n\n3) my face/skin coloration, condition, and detail appear unnatural.  It looks great and very youthful but not super realistic, especially when looking up close.\n\nHow can these issues be addressed?  \n\nThank you.\n\nDan Ziony\nReal Estate Advisor\nPalo Alto | Menlo Park | Peninsula | Silicon Valley\n\nDRE#: 01380339\n650-201-1010\n\n\nOn Fri, Mar 28, 2025 at 3:37 PM Ai SuitUp <info@aisuitup.com> wrote:\n\nYour AI generated headshots are ready!\n\nHello!\n\nThank you for patiently waiting.

    "description": "This is a follow-up to your previous request #8598 \"Re: [Ai SuitUp] Your AI Gen...\"\n\nGood morning Chiara,\n\nThank you for your assistance. I tried the AI Suit Up upload again and unfortunately I don't think the images are suitable. Is it possible to obtain a refund?\n\nIf you'd like to relay feedback to the team working on this, my thoughts would be to:\n-Limit variation in face shape and body shape\n-Allow customers to choose which \"outfit\" works (I.e., if there is a photo that resembles you closely but it's in a turtleneck photograph and you need it in a suit and tie, this would be unusable.)\n-Perhaps allow users to upload a video of themselves for a more realistic dynamic data input instead of something static like a photograph.\n\nThank you again.\n\nBest,\nGreg",

    "description": "Dear AI SuitUp Customer Service,\n\n \n\nI’m writing to share some feedback on my “Executive / Ultimate” experience using the AI SuitUp Headshot Generator, and to enquire about next steps.\n\n \n\nOverall, I found the process easy to navigate and not difficult to use. That said, I’ve noticed that some of your newer competitors are setting higher expectations by offering more variety in their photos such as the ability to toggle between wearing glasses or not, and more customisation options to adjust features like hair length, mouth & eye positions, and expressions.\n\n \n\nWhile a few of the photos generated through AI SuitUp are usable for low-resolution purposes, I didn’t feel that any one image captured a version of me that I’m confident using for higher-resolution purposes. In several images, the positioning of my eyes appeared slightly off when glasses were rendered. In others, the glasses looked realistic, but the hairstyle didn’t reflect me. In some cases, the smile or teeth were noticeably inauthentic.\n\n \n\nI am disappointed that the AI SuitUp generator did not offer a mix of with-glasses and without-glasses portraits, even though I included both types in my training photos. Many newer platforms provide both portraits and do so with as few as 8–12 input images. This flexibility in the final portraits allows users more choices to select what best represents them based on how the generator made them look with glasses vs without glasses.\n\n \n\nWith that in mind, I’m considering getting another set of portraits without glasses, which I’ve seen offered by other services. Before I do, I wanted to check whether AI SuitUp could include this option under the original “Executive / Ultimate” package I purchased.\n\n \n\nTo be clear, I’m not asking for a refund, but I’m also not fully satisfied with the current set of photos. If a set of photos of me “without glasses” would require a full repurchase, I may explore alternative providers.\n\n \n\nThanks in advance for your time, and I look forward to your response.\n\n \n\nKind regards,\n\nNancy Goletsos",

I am wondering if there is a particular package or offering that would make the most sense for an event where people would be taking their photos onsite to be submitted for their headshots. I would be interested in purchasing headshots for around 50-75 people. If you could please share more information and pricing that would be great!\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\nArielle\n\nArielle Lieberman\nBentley University, Class of 2026\n\n\nBENTLEY UNIVERSITY\n\n175 Forest Street | Waltham, MA 02452\n\nbentley.edu/alumni<http://www.bentley.edu/alumni>\n\nFacebook<http://facebook.com/bentleyuniversity.alumni> | Twitter<http://twitter.com/bentleyalumni> | Instagram<https://www.instagram.com/bentleyalumni/> | LinkedIn<https://www.linkedin.com/groups/924/>",

While we understand your request, we believe that a refund would not be appropriate, as the product was offered as described on our website.\n\nIn light of these clarifications, I will assign your request to the team member responsible for handling team packages so that they can give you more details.\n\nSincerely,\nAI SuitUp Team\n\n\nOn 2025 M02 6 15:45:45 UTC, Alexi Arlidge alexi.arlidge@b-cap.ch wrote:\n\nHi Chiara,\n\nI think this is ambiguous and very open to interpretation. You yourself say 'suggesting that the service is intended for individual'. I would argue that it does not 'suggest' the service is for an individual, and with 100 headshots provided, could be used for multiple people. As i say, it's open to interpretation. No where does it state - per individual, which I believe to be misleading. The 16 photos, I took to be the minimum required to achieve a good result per person, not as an entirety.\n\nPlease could you advise what price you offer for a team of ten. Do we also get to choose options for backgrounds, clothing etc?\n\nIf the multiple package option does not suit our requirements, can the package purchased be refunded?\n\nThank you\n\nAlexi\n\n\nAlexi Arlidge\n\nMarketing and Media Consultant\n\n[https://aisuitupsupport.zendesk.com/attachments/token/qmF6OxkNL0kGFXsFyoiM4wuRe/?name=Outlook-n3drc5gq.png]\n\nB Capital Services Ltd | 48 Dover Street | London | W1S 4FF | United Kingdom\n\nMobile: +44 7920 454 706 | Office: +44 203 174 0861\n\nwww.bcapital.partners<http://www.bcapital.partners/>\n\nB Capital’s Latest News<http://bcapital.partners/press>\n\nLinkedIn<https://www.linkedin.com/company/b-capital-s.a./mycompany/> | @BCapital_<https://twitter.com/search?q=%40bcapital_&src=typed_query> | bcapitalpartners<http://instagram.com/bcapitalpartners/>\n\n\n\nB Capital Services Ltd is a limited liability partnership registered in England and Wales with the registered number OC337010.

Our website and the upload process indicate that you must upload 16 pictures of yourself (and not with others in them), suggesting that the service is intended for individual use. If you could provide me with the location where you obtained the confusion that you could use a single generation for multiple people, it would be greatly appreciated so that we can further clarify. Please note that not all the pictures generated will be flawless, and we strive to provide approximately 5-10 satisfactory options for your generation.\n\nIf further clarification is required, please do not hesitate to contact me. If you want to proceed with the headshots for the whole team, let me know, and I'd be happy to help with the process. The solution is to purchase multiple packages in one go; we'll provide you with a payment invoice and a link for each team member; also, the invoice process is streamlined in this case because only a single payment is made.\n\nBest regards,\nChiara, AI SuitUp Team\n\nThis email is a service from Ai SuitUp.

    "description": "Hello Godspower,\nI hope you're doing well! My name is Simone Restelli, founder of AI SuitUp (aisuitup.com), the pioneer in AI Headshots genertion.\n\nI’ve personally been interviewed by _The Wall Street Journal_ as a subject matter expert in AI-generated headshots (WSJ article here).\n\nI’m reaching out because I noticed you’ve already covered the topic of AI headshots in https://nairatips.com/best-ai-linkedin-photo-generators/, and I believe our latest model represents an outstanding addition to this growing field.\n\nWe’ve just released a new version of our algorithm, delivering the most photorealistic headshots available, powered by FLUX, an advanced text-to-image model developed by Black Forest Labs. Using the LORA technique, users can fine-tune the model with just a few selfies to create personalized, professional headshots.\n\nYou can learn more about our latest model and see some examples yourself in this detailed guide.\n\nWe are open to discussing options for a feature and, if you’re interested, I’d be happy to offer you access to our Beta for free so you can try it yourself. You can use this link to explore it.\n\nPlease consider we also running a very convenient affiliate program on Rewardful in case you are interested, more information here.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\nBest regards,\n\nSimone Restelli\nFounder, AI SuitUp",
