I wanted to reach out and ask if you'd be open to being featured in a short case study on our blog. You've been using our team platform, and we think your story could really inspire others looking for a similar solution.

To make it super easy, we’ve prepared a short doc with a few questions you can answer at your convenience. If you'd prefer a quick call instead, I'm more than happy to schedule one and handle the writing myself—you’d just have to review and approve the final version.
